Below is a mechanistic “map” for why SK‑MES‑1 (lung squamous) could be hypersensitive to CRISPR knockout of GSR (glutathione‑disulfide reductase), tying your dependency list to the mutation profile and redox/ER biology.

Executive summary
- SK‑MES‑1 likely relies almost exclusively on the glutathione system to keep its cysteine/disulfide redox balance in check. A splice‑site mutation in TXNRD1 (thioredoxin reductase 1) collapses the alternate thioredoxin pathway, so GSR becomes nonredundant. At the same time, multiple features point to heavy ER proteostasis/oxidative‑folding stress (HYOU1, TMEM258, SLC33A1, SLC35B4 dependencies; PRKCSH nonsense), and there are mutations that would worsen oxidized glutathione handling (ABCC1 nonsense) and mitochondrial redox buffering (SLC25A24 nonsense). Together, this creates a state in which loss of GSR (the enzyme that uses NADPH to recycle GSSG back to GSH) is catastrophic. ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21045148/?utm_source=openai))

1) Collapsed redundancy between the two major thiol antioxidant systems
- Cells buffer two‑electron oxidants through partially redundant glutathione/GR (GSR) and thioredoxin/TXNRD systems. When one arm is impaired, the other becomes essential. Your callout of a TXNRD1 splice‑acceptor variant suggests loss of thioredoxin reductase activity, forcing reliance on GSR. Genetic ablation of Txnrd1 makes tumors highly susceptible to glutathione pathway disruption, underscoring this synthetic‑lethal relationship. Thus, CRISPR‑KO of GSR in SK‑MES‑1 would eliminate the remaining functional arm. ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21045148/?utm_source=openai))

- What GSR does: it reduces GSSG back to GSH using NADPH; pharmacologic GR inhibition increases GSSG and protein S‑glutathionylation—an indicator of thiol stress. Removing GSR genetically would be expected to drive GSSG accumulation and widespread protein thiol oxidation. ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18796312/?utm_source=openai))

2) Strong evidence of ER proteostasis and oxidative‑folding stress
- Four of the top dependencies are core to ER protein folding/glycosylation: HYOU1/GRP170 (ER Hsp70‑like chaperone and BiP nucleotide‑exchange factor), TMEM258 (required OST subunit for N‑linked glycosylation), SLC33A1/AT‑1 (imports acetyl‑CoA into ER; regulates UPR/autophagy), and SLC35B4 (UDP‑GlcNAc/UDP‑Xyl transporter to ER/Golgi). Dependency on these proteins indicates that SK‑MES‑1 must sustain high secretory/glycoprotein flux and is under ER stress, a condition that intrinsically generates H2O2 during disulfide bond formation. In the ER, glutathione is a critical buffer that limits ERO1‑dependent oxidation and supports PDI‑mediated isomerization; when GSH is not regenerated by GSR, ER redox balance tips toward hyperoxidation and UPR‑mediated death. ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8983141/?utm_source=openai))

- ER oxidative folding produces peroxides: ERO1 activity and PRDX4‑coupled cycles generate H2O2 within the ER lumen. ER catalase or PRDX4 normally consumes this peroxide; if GSH/GSR buffering is compromised, peroxide‑driven damage and mispairing of disulfides escalate. This matches the HYOU1 dependency (cells need maximal ER chaperone capacity) and would make GSR loss especially toxic. ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20627953/?utm_source=openai))

- Mutations that amplify ER stress: a nonsense in PRKCSH (glucosidase II β) disrupts N‑glycan trimming and the calnexin/calreticulin cycle, which impairs glycoprotein folding and heightens IRE1–XBP1 signaling/UPR load. In such a setting, glutathione‑dependent reduction steps become even more vital. ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19605557/?utm_source=openai))

- Hexosamine pathway pressure: a stop‑gained mutation in GFPT1 (GFAT1), the rate‑limiting enzyme for producing UDP‑GlcNAc, compromises the supply of nucleotide sugars for N‑/O‑glycosylation. SLC35B4 (UDP‑GlcNAc/UDP‑Xyl transporter) being a top dependency fits a model in which SK‑MES‑1 already struggles to maintain glycan flux and is hypersensitive to any further ER stress induced by loss of GSR‑mediated GSH recycling. ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31272438/?utm_source=openai))

3) Trapping oxidized glutathione inside the cell
- ABCC1/MRP1 exports glutathione conjugates and GSSG. Your ABCC1 nonsense mutation would reduce GSSG efflux, so when GSR is lost and GSSG rises, the cell cannot export the excess; retained GSSG pushes the GSH:GSSG ratio toward oxidation and promotes cytotoxic protein S‑glutathionylation. ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16539673/?utm_source=openai))

4) Mitochondrial/energetic context that increases ROS pressure
- SLC25A24 (APC1; ATP‑Mg/Pi carrier) stop‑gained mutation removes a mitochondrial stress‑protection valve: APC1 helps buffer mitochondrial Ca2+ and supports adenine nucleotide flux; its loss sensitizes cells to oxidative stress and calcium overload. That background makes the cell even more dependent on cytosolic/ER antioxidant capacity provided by the glutathione cycle.

5) Why ADPGK shows up as a co‑dependency with GSR
- ADPGK is an ER‑localized ADP‑dependent glucokinase that helps couple glucose sensing to ER biogenesis and glycosylation; ADPGK loss induces ER stress and metabolic catastrophe in activated cells. Its prominence in your dependency list is consistent with SK‑MES‑1 relying on ER homeostasis pathways. In a cell already stressed in ER redox/glycosylation, GSR loss likely synergizes with this dependency to trigger lethal UPR. ([nature.com](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-019-50566-6?utm_source=openai))

Putting it together
- The combination of (i) disabled thioredoxin arm (TXNRD1 splice variant), (ii) heavy ER oxidative‑folding/glycosylation stress (HYOU1/TMEM258/SLC33A1/SLC35B4 dependencies; PRKCSH truncation), (iii) impaired clearance of oxidized glutathione (ABCC1 truncation), and (iv) compromised mitochondrial redox buffering (SLC25A24 truncation) converges to make GSR the single point of failure for maintaining a permissive GSH:GSSG redox environment. Hence, SK‑MES‑1 is “super sensitive” to GSR knockout. ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21045148/?utm_source=openai))

Predictions you can test (quick validation plan)
- Baseline state: elevated GSSG and protein S‑glutathionylation; strong UPR tone (BiP, CHOP, spliced XBP1). After GSR KO: sharp drop in GSH:GSSG ratio, surge in ER‑stress markers, and loss of viability; partial rescue with GSH‑ethyl ester or NAC; stronger rescue with TXNRD1 re‑expression. ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2709784/?utm_source=openai))
- Genetic/chemical epistasis:
  - TXNRD1 add‑back should blunt GSR‑KO lethality; conversely, TXNRD inhibition (auranofin) should synergize with partial GSR loss. ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21045148/?utm_source=openai))
  - ER‑targeted catalase or PRDX4 overexpression should mitigate GSR‑KO toxicity if ER peroxide is a key driver. ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20627953/?utm_source=openai))
  - Overexpressing MRP1 should lower intracellular GSSG and partially rescue GSR‑KO. ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16539673/?utm_source=openai))
- Live‑cell reporters: cytosolic and ER roGFP2‑based probes should show rapid oxidation after GSR KO, more pronounced in ER. ER oxidation should lessen with ERO1 or OST (TMEM258) suppression. ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15161913/?utm_source=openai))

Why the details above fit your specific gene lists
- Top co‑dependencies are enriched for ER proteostasis/glycosylation (HYOU1, TMEM258, SLC33A1, SLC35B4), which are exactly the processes most sensitive to perturbations in GSH/GSSG and peroxide handling during oxidative protein folding. GSR maintains the glutathione pool that limits ERO1/PRDX4‑generated oxidizing equivalents and enables proper PDI‑mediated isomerization; disabling it in a cell already reliant on these pathways is lethal.
