Here’s a concise mechanistic picture for why UPCISCC090 is exceptionally sensitive to FOXE1 knockout, tying together what’s known about this cell line, its dependencies, and its mutations.

Summary (the short version)
- UPCISCC090 is an HPV16-positive oral/tongue HNSCC line that carries hundreds of HPV16 copies. In this line, HPV integration events flank focal amplifications at two loci: PIM1 (~16×) and FOXE1 (~7×). Such focal amplifications often create “lineage-transcription factor addiction,” making the amplified TF (here, FOXE1) essential for survival. This cleanly explains why CRISPR-KO of FOXE1 severely impairs viability. ([cellosaurus.org](https://www.cellosaurus.org/CVCL_1899?utm_source=openai))
- Biology around FOXE1 supports this: FOXE1 is a GLI2 target in epidermal keratinocytes (the lineage HNSCC derives from) and can drive EMT programs via ZEB1. UPCISCC090 also harbors a GLI2 missense (S562I), which could further tune this axis. Together, an HPV-driven FOXE1 amplification plus a keratinocyte Hedgehog/GLI context can create strong FOXE1 dependence. ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15140221/?utm_source=openai))
- The rest of the dependency/mutation context (HPV E6–UBE3A, proteasome/gankyrin PSMD10, PIM1 amplification, SOX2 lineage reliance) is characteristic of HPV+ HNSCC and helps maintain a transcriptional/proteostasis state that becomes brittle when you remove the amplified lineage TF (FOXE1). ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6842930/?utm_source=openai))

Why FOXE1 specifically?
1) HPV integration–driven focal amplification at 9q22
- In UPCISCC090, whole-genome profiling identified clusters of HPV16 integrants that flank focal amplifications. Critically, this includes a ~7-fold amplification of FOXE1 at 9q22, and a ~16-fold amplification of PIM1 at 6p21. In the same study, perturbing PIM1 (CRISPR/shRNA/chemical) reduced viability, demonstrating that HPV-driven focal amplifications can create hard dependencies. The FOXE1 focal amplification in the very same line strongly points to a similar “addiction” for FOXE1. ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7239795/?utm_source=openai))

2) FOXE1 is wired into keratinocyte/Hedgehog transcriptional circuitry
- FOXE1 is a direct transcriptional target of GLI2 and is expressed in basal keratinocytes and basal cell carcinoma, placing FOXE1 inside an epidermal Hedgehog/GLI network that can be co-opted in squamous cancers. UPCISCC090 also carries a GLI2 missense variant (S562I). While the specific effect of S562I isn’t established here, the presence of a GLI2 alteration together with FOXE1 amplification is consistent with an activated GLI2→FOXE1 axis in squamous epithelium. ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15140221/?utm_source=openai))

3) FOXE1 can drive EMT programs through ZEB1
- FOXE1 directly binds the ZEB1 promoter and upregulates ZEB1, an EMT master regulator. In multiple epithelial cancers, EMT circuitry contributes to survival, invasion, and plasticity. In HPV+ HNSCC, E6/E7 themselves can push EMT-TFs (including ZEB1), so removing FOXE1 would be expected to collapse a ZEB1-centric program these cells leverage. ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6993207/?utm_source=openai))

Why the rest of the dependency/mutation context strengthens this model
- HPV16/E6–UBE3A axis: UBE3A (E6AP) is needed by E6 to degrade p53; UBE3A being a top dependency is classic for HPV+ lines and indicates sustained viral oncoprotein wiring. PSMD10 (gankyrin), another top hit, cooperates with MDM2 to degrade p53/RB and supports proteasome-driven oncoprotein turnover. These dependencies flag a proteostasis/transcriptional state that becomes acutely dependent on key TF nodes amplified by HPV events—here, FOXE1. ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6842930/?utm_source=openai))
- PIM1: The same study that mapped FOXE1 amplification proved that HPV integration amplified PIM1 and that PIM1 is a functional dependency in UPCISCC090. Co-dependence on FOXE1 and PIM1 fits with a broader theme of HPV integration creating local amplifications that convert nearby genes into drivers/addictions. ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7239795/?utm_source=openai))
- SOX2: SOX2 is frequently amplified at 3q26 in HNSCC and acts as a squamous lineage TF; its appearance among the top dependencies in UPCISCC090 tells you the cell is “lineage wired.” Having two lineage TF nodes (SOX2 plus HPV-amplified FOXE1) makes the network particularly vulnerable to losing FOXE1. ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25631445/?utm_source=openai))

How the mutation list fits
- GLI2 S562I: The GLI2→FOXE1 link is established in keratinocytes; a GLI2 missense could modulate activity (direction not proven here), plausibly reinforcing FOXE1 transcription in this background. ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15140221/?utm_source=openai))
- PTEN missense variants (G127R, M134I) and RAF1 S259F: These favor PI3K–AKT/MAPK signaling. PIM1 (amplified here) cross-talks with these pathways; this makes the cell robust to stress as long as the lineage TF circuitry (including FOXE1) remains intact—remove FOXE1 and the state collapses. ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7239795/?utm_source=openai))
- UBE3A I150S (plus dependency): The exact effect of I150S isn’t clear, but the strong dependency on UBE3A is expected in HPV+ settings because E6 relies on E6AP to disable p53; this underscores how viral wiring contributes to fragility when key TFs are removed. ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6842930/?utm_source=openai))

One important caveat: copy-number effects in CRISPR screens
- CRISPR cutting in highly amplified regions can create gene-independent toxicity. DepMap analyses mitigate this (CERES/Chronos), but very high copy number can still inflate apparent essentiality. Given FOXE1 is ~7× amplified here, it’s wise to validate with CRISPRi or RNAi and rescue experiments. ([nature.com](https://www.nature.com/articles/ng.3984?utm_source=openai))

What I would do next to confirm mechanism
- Genomics and expression
  - Verify FOXE1 copy number (CN) and expression in your specific UPCISCC090 batch (DNA CN by ddPCR/array; mRNA/protein by qPCR/Western). Confirm HPV integration breakpoints near FOXE1 if WGS data are available. ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7239795/?utm_source=openai))
- Orthogonal perturbations
  - Perform CRISPRi and independent si/shRNA knockdowns of FOXE1; include cDNA rescue lacking the guide-binding site. This will deconvolve true dependency from CN CRISPR-cutting toxicity. ([nature.com](https://www.nature.com/articles/ng.3984?utm_source=openai))
- Pathway readouts
  - Measure GLI2 and ZEB1 targets after FOXE1 depletion. If the GLI2–FOXE1–ZEB1 axis drives viability, FOXE1 loss should downshift ZEB1 and partially revert EMT signatures. Consider testing a GLI inhibitor (e.g., GANT61) for synthetic interactions with FOXE1 knockdown. ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15140221/?utm_source=openai))
- Dependency context
  - Confirm the expected HPV+ wiring: knock down UBE3A and/or perturb PSMD10 to verify p53-axis responses; test PIM1 inhibitor sensitivity (already shown for UPCISCC090) and look for additive/synergistic effects with FOXE1 perturbation. ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6842930/?utm_source=openai))

Take‑home
- The most parsimonious explanation for extreme FOXE1 sensitivity in UPCISCC090 is HPV-integration–driven FOXE1 amplification that creates lineage-TF addiction in a squamous/keratinocyte context where FOXE1 is a GLI2-regulated node capable of enforcing EMT/ZEB1 programs. This dovetails with the line’s other HPV-linked dependencies (UBE3A/E6AP, PSMD10) and its PIM1 amp-driven survival wiring. Validate with CN-aware perturbations and pathway readouts as above.
