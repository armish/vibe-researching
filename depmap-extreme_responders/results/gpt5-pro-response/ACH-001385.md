Short answer
RPMI-2650 is extremely sensitive to NUTM1 knockout because this cell line carries a BRD4–NUTM1 fusion that functions as the primary oncogenic driver. Disrupting NUTM1 with CRISPR eliminates the NUT portion of the fusion, collapsing the BRD4–NUTM1-driven chromatin/transcription program and triggering rapid differentiation and growth arrest. ([cellosaurus.org](https://www.cellosaurus.org/CVCL_1664))

Why this makes RPMI-2650 “addicted” to NUTM1
- The cell line harbors a BRD4 exon 15–NUTM1 exon 2 fusion (BRD4–NUTM1 ex15:ex2), documented for RPMI‑2650 in Cellosaurus and originally uncovered by large-scale CCLE/Genentech transcriptomics. This places RPMI‑2650 in the NUT carcinoma spectrum. ([cellosaurus.org](https://www.cellosaurus.org/CVCL_1664))
- BRD4–NUTM1 recruits and hyperactivates p300/CBP, creating huge hyperacetylated “megadomains” (100 kb–2 Mb) that drive expression of progrowth, antidifferentiation factors such as MYC, TP63 and SOX2; this is the core dependency. ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4526735/?utm_source=openai))
- Depleting the NUTM1 portion of the fusion (siRNA/CRISPR) in NUT carcinoma models causes collapse of megadomains and rapid squamous differentiation with growth arrest; pharmacologic disruption with BET or p300 HAT inhibitors produces the same phenotype. That is exactly the biology a NUTM1 CRISPR-KO would hit in RPMI‑2650. ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3149357/?utm_source=openai))
- NUTM1 is otherwise testis-restricted and nonessential in most somatic contexts; its essentiality in RPMI‑2650 is therefore a fusion-specific oncogene addiction rather than a house‑keeping requirement. ([abcam.com](https://www.abcam.com/en-us/targets/nutm1/27859?utm_source=openai))

How the other “top dependencies” fit this picture
Although NUTM1 is the obvious driver, several of the co-dependencies you listed are consistent with the transcriptional/translational and metabolic pressures created by BRD4–NUTM1:
- TAF11 (TFIID subunit): Core Pol II initiation factor. BRD4–NUTM1-driven hypertranscription plausibly increases reliance on general transcription machinery. ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TAF11?utm_source=openai))
- FBXO28: An E3 ligase that enhances MYC-driven transcription by non‑proteolytic ubiquitylation of MYC and recruitment of p300; dependence here is coherent with the MYC-centric program of NUT carcinoma. ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3721474/?utm_source=openai))
- TRUB1 and TRMT2B: mRNA/tRNA/rRNA modification enzymes (pseudouridylation and m5U methylation, respectively). Increased transcription and translation demand in fusion‑driven states can heighten reliance on RNA-modifying enzymes that support efficient gene expression and mitochondrial translation. ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28073919/?utm_source=openai))
- NDUFAF5: complex I assembly factor; and NDUFB8 is frameshift-mutant in your list. This combination suggests a mitochondrial/OXPHOS vulnerability that often emerges when fast‑proliferating, hypertranscribing cells lean on efficient energy production. (NDUFAF5 dependence in the setting of a complex I subunit lesion is a plausible compensatory dependency.) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7237155/?utm_source=openai))
- PSENEN, GJC1, CDH11, IRS4: context‑specific survival or signaling/adhesion requirements frequently appear among top hits in single cell lines in DepMap; they may modulate the growth/differentiation balance established by BRD4–NUTM1 but are not known canonical NUT carcinoma drivers. ([depmap.org](https://depmap.org/rnai/?utm_source=openai))

Do the mutations you listed explain the NUTM1 dependency?
- The main explanation is the BRD4–NUTM1 fusion itself. NUT carcinoma typically shows few recurrent cooperating mutations; the fusion is sufficient to drive malignancy and oncogene addiction. ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10690098/?utm_source=openai))
- One potentially relevant alteration is SUZ12 p.R563H. Partial PRC2 impairment can globally reduce H3K27me3 and increase H3K27ac, favoring open chromatin. While we cannot infer functional impact of this specific missense without experimentation, PRC2 loss is known to shift chromatin toward acetylation and can sensitize cells to bromodomain-axis perturbations—changes that would mechanistically complement BRD4–NUTM1’s p300‑driven hyperacetylation. Consider this a hypothesis to test rather than a proven contributor in RPMI‑2650. ([academic.oup.com](https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/38/15/4958/2409390?utm_source=openai))

Technical note about the screening data
Modern DepMap CRISPR dependency scores are corrected for copy-number–related false positives using the CERES model, so the extreme NUTM1 dependency you observe is unlikely to be a simple CN artifact and is consistent with true fusion addiction. ([nature.com](https://www.nature.com/articles/ng.3984?utm_source=openai))

What you can do next to validate/extend
- Confirm the fusion and its junction in your RPMI‑2650 cells (RNA‑seq fusion caller; BRD4–NUTM1 FISH; NUT IHC). Cellosaurus reports BRD4 ex15–NUTM1 ex2 in RPMI‑2650. ([cellosaurus.org](https://www.cellosaurus.org/CVCL_1664))
- Map your CRISPR guides to NUTM1 exons actually present in the fusion transcript to ensure on‑target knockout of the fusion allele. ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4526735/?utm_source=openai))
- Run short‑term pharmacology: BET inhibitor (e.g., birabresib/OTX015, molibresib, or other BETi) and/or p300/CBP HAT inhibitor A‑485. Expect differentiation and growth arrest if the cells are truly fusion‑driven; note that BRD4–NUTM1 exon variants can modulate BET inhibitor sensitivity. ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26976114/?utm_source=openai))
- If you want to probe co‑dependencies mechanistically: test whether MYC overexpression rescues growth after NUTM1 knockdown (a classic readout in NUT carcinoma). ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10690098/?utm_source=openai))

Bottom line
The simplest, strongly supported explanation is that RPMI‑2650 carries a pathogenic BRD4–NUTM1 fusion. NUTM1 CRISPR‑KO disables the fusion oncoprotein, causing collapse of the megadomain‑driven transcriptional state, induction of squamous differentiation, and loss of viability—hence the “super sensitivity” you observed.
