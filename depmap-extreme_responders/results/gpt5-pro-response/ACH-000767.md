Short answer
NCI‑H526 is a POU2F3‑high “tuft cell–like” SCLC (the SCLC‑P subtype). In this lineage state, the dedicated POU2F3 co‑activator POU2AF2 (formerly C11orf53; also called OCA‑T1) is required to keep the tuft‑cell enhancer program active. Removing POU2AF2 collapses POU2F3‑driven enhancers, redistributes SWI/SNF chromatin remodelers, and shuts down survival genes—hence the extreme CRISPR‑KO sensitivity.

How the data you provided fit this model

1) Co‑dependency signature screams “SCLC‑P/tuft cell”
- POU2F3 is the lineage‑defining master regulator in tuft‑cell–like SCLC and is a potent dependency specifically in lines such as NCI‑H526. Seeing POU2F3 near the top of your list is the first clue. ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6075037/?utm_source=openai))
- ASCL2 is a tuft‑lineage TF that becomes selectively required in POU2F3+ SCLC; its presence among the top dependencies matches prior CRISPR screens. ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6075037/?utm_source=openai))
- HMX2 and HMX3 are transcription factors enriched in tuft cells by single‑cell atlases, again matching a tuft‑cell program and explaining why they score as dependencies. ([proteinatlas.org](https://www.proteinatlas.org/humanproteome/single%2Bcell/transcription%2Bfactor%2Blandscape/single%2Bcell%2Btype/Specialized%2Bepithelial%2Bcells?utm_source=openai))
- NECTIN4 (a cell‑adhesion receptor) often marks epithelial, luminal‑like programs; while not uniquely “tuft,” NECTIN4 dependency is consistent with a non‑neuroendocrine epithelial state typical of SCLC‑P. ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34108177/?utm_source=openai))

2) POU2AF2 is the dedicated co‑activator for POU2F3 in this lineage
- Two independent groups showed that the previously uncharacterized proteins C11orf53 and COLCA2 were renamed OCA‑T1/POU2AF2 and OCA‑T2/POU2AF3, respectively, and act as POU2F3‑specific co‑activators in tuft cells and tuft‑like SCLC. ([nature.com](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-022-04842-7?utm_source=openai))
- Mechanistically, POU2AF2 binds POU2F3 on chromatin, maintains H3K27ac and chromatin accessibility at POU2F3 target enhancers, and is required for expression of tuft‑cell identity genes (e.g., TRPM5, SOX9, GFI1B). CRISPR loss of POU2AF2 lowers enhancer activity and induces apoptosis. These experiments were done directly in NCI‑H526. ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9534498/?utm_source=openai))
- A follow‑up study showed that POU2AF2 depletion causes global redistribution of SWI/SNF (mSWI/SNF) occupancy and 3D genome changes, reinforcing why its loss is catastrophic in this state. ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38453939/?utm_source=openai))

3) NCI‑H526 specifically relies on POU2AF2 (and not its paralog)
- DepMap‑linked analyses identified C11orf53/POU2AF2 as essential in COR‑L311, NCI‑H211, and NCI‑H526, whereas COLCA2/POU2AF3 is essential in NCI‑H1048—mutually exclusive, consistent with differential expression of the co‑activator paralogs. This explains why your line is “super sensitive” to POU2AF2 KO: there’s no redundant OCA‑T paralog to back it up. ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9576728/?utm_source=openai))
- The original POU2F3 discovery paper already flagged NCI‑H526 as one of the few SCLC lines exquisitely dependent on POU2F3, matching the co‑activator reliance you observe. ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6075037/?utm_source=openai))

4) Mutational context is consistent with a non‑NE tuft state that is “lineage‑addicted”
- Your variants include canonical SCLC lesions in TP53 and RB1, which are shared across SCLC subtypes and set the stage for reliance on lineage TF circuits. SCLC‑P (POU2F3+) tumors often show low neuroendocrine marker expression and may be TTF‑1 negative; your TTF1 splice‑donor variant fits this biology. ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9427708/?utm_source=openai))
- Recent work ties the POU2F3 program tightly to SWI/SNF activity; chemical or genetic disruption of mSWI/SNF (including ncBAF/BRD9) preferentially impairs POU2F3+ SCLC. This helps explain why perturbing a key POU2F3 co‑activator (POU2AF2) is lethal. ([repository.cshl.edu](https://repository.cshl.edu/id/eprint/41620/?utm_source=openai))

Putting it together mechanistically
- Dependency network: POU2AF2 ⇄ POU2F3 at tuft‑cell enhancers → activates tuft identity/survival genes (e.g., ASCL2, SOX9) with mSWI/SNF support. Knock out POU2AF2 → enhancer H3K27ac and accessibility fall → SWI/SNF retargets → lineage program collapses → rapid loss of viability. The extremely deep dropout you see for POU2AF2 is exactly what was reported in NCI‑H526. ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9534498/?utm_source=openai))

Notes on specific items in your top‑10 list
- POU2F3 and ASCL2: hallmark SCLC‑P dependencies. ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6075037/?utm_source=openai))
- HMX2/HMX3: tuft‑cell–enriched TFs; their dependency is expected in a POU2F3 program. ([proteinatlas.org](https://www.proteinatlas.org/humanproteome/single%2Bcell/transcription%2Bfactor%2Blandscape/single%2Bcell%2Btype/Specialized%2Bepithelial%2Bcells?utm_source=openai))
- NECTIN4: consistent with an epithelial, non‑NE phenotype; also a druggable surface protein in other cancers, though its role in SCLC‑P is still being defined. ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34108177/?utm_source=openai))
- SWT1/CLK2 and other RNA‑processing hits: POU2F3‑driven states often show splicing/RNA‑processing liabilities; in NCI‑H526 there is a truncating PRPF8 mutation in your list, which could further sensitize to RNA‑processing perturbations, although that link is more speculative. (No definitive published causal tie yet.)

What this suggests you can do next
- Confirm the subtype: check that NCI‑H526 expresses POU2F3 and POU2AF2 (C11orf53) but not COLCA2 (POU2AF3), and shows low classical NE markers and TTF‑1—typical of SCLC‑P. ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6075037/?utm_source=openai))
- Mechanism validation: after POU2AF2 CRISPR‑KO, profile H3K27ac/ATAC‑seq and POU2F3 ChIP‑seq around tuft‑cell super‑enhancers (e.g., SOX9, GFI1B, TRPM5) to recapitulate the enhancer collapse and SWI/SNF redistribution reported in NCI‑H526. ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9534498/?utm_source=openai))
- Therapeutic angle: because POU2F3+ SCLC depends on mSWI/SNF, evaluate SMARCA2/4 ATPase inhibitors or BRD9 degraders as indirect ways to extinguish the POU2F3 program; these were recently shown to suppress POU2F3‑positive SCLC in vitro and in vivo. ([repository.cshl.edu](https://repository.cshl.edu/id/eprint/41620/?utm_source=openai))

Bottom line
Your dependency and mutation profiles are exactly what you’d expect for a POU2F3‑driven, tuft‑cell–like SCLC. In that state, POU2AF2 is the non‑redundant co‑activator that keeps the lineage program alive—so knocking it out is a single‑point failure for NCI‑H526.
