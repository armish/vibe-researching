Here’s a concise mechanistic model for why MM100511 is hypersensitive to BRAP loss, grounded in the genotype and in what’s known about BRAP biology and MAPK-pathway “overdose” toxicities.

Why BRAP matters mechanistically
- BRAP (aka IMP/BRAP2) is a Ras effector and RING‑E3 ligase that limits ERK pathway amplitude by restraining the KSR1 scaffold. It disrupts KSR1 oligomerization and Raf–MEK complex assembly, acting as a “signal threshold” brake on Raf–MEK–ERK. Removing BRAP therefore lowers the threshold for ERK activation and can drive pathway hyperactivation. ([nature.com](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature02237?utm_source=openai))
- BRAP can also retain NLS‑containing proteins in the cytoplasm, but its best‑supported role here is as a negative regulator of KSR1‑dependent ERK signaling. ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20040518/?utm_source=openai))

What’s special about MM100511
- The cell line harbors KIT K642E—an activating KIT mutation seen in acral/mucosal melanoma—which makes cells KIT‑dependent (as your dependency list reports) and feeds into MAPK signaling. ([jamanetwork.com](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamadermatology/fullarticle/1913663?utm_source=openai))
- Among its top dependencies is STYX, a pseudo‑phosphatase that binds ERK and restrains its spatiotemporal activity; depleting STYX increases ERK activity. Needing both STYX and BRAP strongly suggests this line relies on ERK “brakes” to keep signaling in a permissive, non‑toxic range. ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23847209/?utm_source=openai))

The unifying model: ERK “oncogene overdose”
- Many RTK/RAS‑pathway cancers must actively restrain ERK; if ERK is driven too high, cells undergo growth arrest/apoptosis. This has been shown genetically and pharmacologically (e.g., KRAS+EGFR co‑expression; DUSP6 dependency) and extends to melanoma, where loss of ERK phosphatases like DUSP4 triggers toxic ERK hyperactivation. ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30475204/?utm_source=openai))
- In a KITK642E‑addicted background, BRAP loss would release KSR1, promoting Raf–MEK complexing and pushing ERK signaling above the tolerated window—producing “oncogene overdose” and cell death. The concurrent STYX dependency fits this same buffering logic. ([nature.com](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature02237?utm_source=openai))

How the other dependencies/mutations fit (supporting context)
- SEL1L (ERAD adaptor) and ZMPSTE24 dependencies imply a proteostasis/nuclear‑envelope stress liability in this line (common in secretory, receptor‑heavy states). While not directly tied to BRAP, they can lower the overall stress tolerance so that ERK hyperactivation from BRAP loss is less survivable. ([elifesciences.org](https://elifesciences.org/articles/41168?utm_source=openai))

Clear experimental predictions you can test
- BRAP KO/KD should increase pMEK/pERK and immediate‑early gene output; MEK or ERK inhibitors should rescue viability after BRAP depletion. ([nature.com](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature02237?utm_source=openai))
- KSR1 loss or KSR1–KSR dimerization interference should mitigate the lethality of BRAP loss. ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29433126/?utm_source=openai))
- Depleting other ERK brakes (e.g., STYX, DUSP6/DUSP4) should phenocopy aspects of BRAP loss; conversely, overexpressing them should blunt BRAP‑loss toxicity. ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23847209/?utm_source=openai))
- In a KIT‑addicted setting, KIT inhibitors (e.g., imatinib) should partially rescue BRAP‑loss lethality by dialing down upstream drive. ([jamanetwork.com](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamadermatology/fullarticle/1913663?utm_source=openai))

Bottom line
- MM100511 carries an activating KIT mutation and is addicted to KIT. BRAP is a gatekeeper that keeps ERK output below a toxic threshold by limiting KSR1‑mediated Raf–MEK complex assembly. Losing BRAP in this genotype unleashes excessive ERK signaling—an oncogene‑overdose state that is selectively lethal—consistent with the parallel dependency on another ERK brake, STYX.

If you want, I can sketch a short bench plan for the BRAP‑KO rescue experiments (CRISPR + ±MEK/ERK/KIT inhibition; ±KSR1 KD; phospho‑proteomics to quantify ERK substrate hyperphosphorylation).
