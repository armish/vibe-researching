Short answer
EKVX almost certainly depends on PTDSS2 because its paralog PTDSS1 carries a truncating mutation (p.E159Ter) in your data. In mammalian cells, PTDSS1 and PTDSS2 are the two, partially redundant enzymes that synthesize phosphatidylserine (PS) by base-exchange from phosphatidylcholine (PTDSS1-biased) or phosphatidylethanolamine (PTDSS2-only). When one paralog is disabled, cells become acutely reliant on the other to maintain essential PS levels; knocking out the remaining enzyme collapses PS biosynthesis and is lethal. Your co-dependency list (notably SELENOI and TMEM258) fits this model. ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22960354/?utm_source=openai))

Why this makes biological sense for EKVX

1) Core pathway logic: PS synthase paralog dependency
- What PTDSS2 does: PTDSS2 (PSS2) catalyzes serine base-exchange on PE to make PS, and together with PTDSS1 (PSS1) provides the only de novo route to PS in mammalian cells; both enzymes reside at ER–mitochondria contact sites (MAMs), where newly made PS feeds mitochondrial and plasma-membrane lipid needs. Either enzyme alone can sustain viability, but loss of both is incompatible with survival. Thus, if PTDSS1 is inactivated, PTDSS2 becomes essential. ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22960354/?utm_source=openai))
- “Reciprocal” precedent: Cancers that delete PTDSS2 become collaterally dependent on PTDSS1; selective PTDSS1 inhibition kills PTDSS2-deleted tumors. This establishes the paralog-based synthetic-lethal logic for the PS synthases and supports the mirror scenario in EKVX (PTDSS1-truncated → PTDSS2 essential). ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36054550/?utm_source=openai))

2) Your top co-dependencies reinforce a PS/PE bottleneck
- SELENOI (a.k.a. EPT1) is the ethanolamine phosphotransferase that performs the last step of the Kennedy pathway to make PE (CDP‑ethanolamine + DAG → PE). A strong dependency on SELENOI suggests EKVX must maintain PE supply—consistent with PTDSS2 needing PE substrate to generate PS when PTDSS1 is lost. Co‑dependence on PTDSS2 and SELENOI is therefore exactly what you’d expect if PS is being produced primarily via PTDSS2 from PE. ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28052917/?utm_source=openai))
- TMEM258 is a required subunit of the oligosaccharyltransferase (OST) complex for N‑linked glycosylation; its loss causes ER stress and apoptosis. Dependence on TMEM258 hints that EKVX already operates near an ER homeostasis threshold. Because PS synthases sit at MAM/ER and supply lipids critical for ER and mitochondrial function, removing the sole remaining PS synthase (PTDSS2) would exacerbate ER stress and trigger cell death. ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5661940/?utm_source=openai))

3) The lipid/mitochondria context makes PS especially non‑negotiable
- PS at the inner plasma membrane leaflet provides the negative charge that recruits many survival signaling proteins (e.g., PDK1/Akt module); depleting PS disrupts this membrane recruitment and signaling. ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3308839/?utm_source=openai))
- PS made at MAMs is also a precursor for mitochondrial PE via PS decarboxylase; perturbing this flow compromises mitochondrial integrity and viability. Removing PTDSS2 when PTDSS1 is already inactive would acutely limit PS flux to mitochondria. ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10938271/?utm_source=openai))

How the EKVX mutation/dependency pattern fits together
- Truncating PTDSS1 p.E159Ter in your call set strongly suggests loss of PSS1 function. With PTDSS1 down, EKVX must synthesize essentially all PS via PTDSS2 from PE—explaining why PTDSS2 ranks as the top CRISPR dependency and why SELENOI (PE supply) co‑scores as a major hit. The added dependency on TMEM258 is consistent with a cell that is sensitive to ER stress; removing the last PS synthase worsens protein/lipid homeostasis and is catastrophic. ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22960354/?utm_source=openai))

Notes on lineage and model system
- EKVX is a non–small cell lung cancer line from the NCI‑60 panel, a context where lipid‑metabolic rewiring is common; while not required to explain the PTDSS2 dependency, this background does not conflict with the PS/PE bottleneck model. ([dtp.cancer.gov](https://dtp.cancer.gov/discovery_development/nci-60/cell_list.htm?utm_source=openai))

What you can test quickly to validate the mechanism
- Rescue genetics: Re‑express a cDNA of wild‑type PTDSS1; if PTDSS2‑KO lethality is due to paralog dependency, PTDSS1 should rescue viability. ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22960354/?utm_source=openai))
- Lipidomic rescue: Supplement cells with PS-containing liposomes and assess whether PTDSS2‑KO growth defects partially rescue; measure PS and PE species by LC‑MS to confirm a PS collapse upon PTDSS2 KO. Background literature supports PS essentiality for membrane charge/signaling and MAM‑to‑mitochondria flux. ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3308839/?utm_source=openai))
- Pathway corroboration: Knock down SELENOI; hypersensitivity in EKVX relative to PTDSS1‑WT controls would further support reliance on the PE→PS route. ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28052917/?utm_source=openai))

Bottom line
EKVX’s extreme sensitivity to PTDSS2 loss is best explained by a classic paralog synthetic‑lethal situation: a truncating PTDSS1 mutation leaves PTDSS2 as the sole PS synthase. Dependencies on SELENOI (to supply PE substrate) and TMEM258 (ER glycoprotein handling/ER‑stress buffer) are coherent with this model and help explain the severity of the PTDSS2‑KO phenotype.
