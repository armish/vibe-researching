EKVX’s extreme sensitivity to PTDSS2 loss is best explained by paralog synthetic lethality stemming from a truncating PTDSS1 mutation. PTDSS1 and PTDSS2 are the two PS synthases in mammalian cells; either can sustain de novo PS production, but losing both is incompatible with survival. With PTDSS1 function truncated, EKVX must rely on PTDSS2; knocking out PTDSS2 collapses PS biosynthesis and kills the cells. The strong co-dependencies on SELENOI and TMEM258 fit this model: SELENOI supplies PE for PS synthesis, and TMEM258 ties ER function and stress responses to PS flux. This pattern is the classic paralog-based synthetic-lethal logic and matches the data for EKVX. The NSCLC origin of EKVX within the NCI-60 panel is a realistic context for lipid-metabolic rewiring that could reveal such a bottleneck.

Other contributing factors are plausible but not as decisive. The SELENOI dependency underscores the need for a steady PE supply to feed PTDSS2’s PS production, yet this alone does not explain why PS loss is lethal when PTDSS1 is already defective. TMEM258’s link to ER stress suggests EKVX operates near an ER homeostasis threshold, so removing the last PS synthase could push the cell over the edge. PS’s role in maintaining mitochondrial lipid balance could amplify the effect since PS produced at MAMs feeds mitochondrial PE. There may be additional, cell-line-specific rewiring that modulates the magnitude of the dependency, but the paralog deletion-driven bottleneck remains the core driver.

Beyond the core mechanism, PS at the inner leaflet recruits signaling proteins like PDK1/Akt, linking lipid synthesis to survival signaling. PS produced at MAMs also serves as a precursor for mitochondrial PE via PS decarboxylase, so blocking PS flux can undermine mitochondrial integrity. For quick validation, re-expressing wild-type PTDSS1 to see if PTDSS2 KO is rescued would be informative, as would lipid rescue with PS-containing liposomes and targeted lipidomics to confirm PS depletion. EKVX’s NSCLC background fits the broader pattern that lipid metabolism can be rewired in cancer, making paralog dependencies a potentially general vulnerability. If confirmed, this paralog-based vulnerability could guide selective strategies that target PTDSS1/PTDSS2 balance in tumors with PTDSS1 loss.
