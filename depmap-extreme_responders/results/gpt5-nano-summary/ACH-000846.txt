The most reasonable lead explanation is that FaDu’s exceptional sensitivity to C7orf25 CRISPR KO reflects a state of chronic translation/RNA surveillance stress created by its mutational and dependency landscape. C7orf25 is a conserved PIN‑like nuclease likely functioning in RNA quality control at the RNA–translation interface, analogous to SMG6 in NMD. FaDu already shows strong dependencies on GTPBP1/2, which rescue stalled ribosomes and trigger the ISR if impaired, and on NRBF2, a regulator of autophagy flux. The combination of a RPS15 G132R hotspot mutation, numerous truncating/splice variants affecting RNA quality, UPF3A involvement, and a truncating FLCN allele creates a background where defects in RNA/translation surveillance are particularly costly. Therefore, losing C7orf25 would plausibly collapse an essential QC/degradation axis, leading to unresolved ribosome stalls, overwhelming proteotoxic stress, and cell death. This synthetic-addiction model best fits the data compared with alternative explanations.

There are additional factors that could contribute, but they are not as strong as the central hypothesis. The FaDu dependencies on GTPBP1/2 and NRBF2 already point to a cell living on the edge of translational stress and proteostasis, so any extra burden can magnify sensitivity. The FLCN truncation primes autophagy/lysosome programs, making FaDu more reliant on autophagy and potentially more vulnerable when RNA/translation QC is compromised. UPF3A variants and the broader suite of splice-site/frameshift variants likely increase aberrant transcripts that must be managed by QC pathways, further sensitizing the cell to C7orf25 loss. The NRF1 L413M change suggests there is already a proteasome bounce-back/aggresome axis at play, so impairing degradation may compound the effect. Taken together, these factors create a background in which C7orf25 is more essential, though none alone would fully explain the hypersensitivity as convincingly as the combined translational stress model.

Some other interesting facts and testable angles emerge from the model. C7orf25 domains and homology place it in the same family as PIN-domain nucleases implicated in RNA surveillance, offering a concrete mechanistic basis for its role. An observed interaction with threonyl-tRNA synthetase further anchors C7orf25 at the RNA–translation interface. Direct biochemical validation in human cells is still limited, so the hypothesis rests on domain logic, genetic dependencies, and FaDu’s mutational context, which can be falsified or supported by targeted experiments. Proposed tests include rescuing FaDu with CRISPR‑resistant wild-type or catalytic-dead C7orf25 and comparing the rescue, assessing ISR markers and ribosome profiling after KO, and performing epistasis analyses with GTPBP1/2 and NRBF2. Additional assays like NMD reporter readouts and checking C7orf25 copy number/expression in FaDu (via DepMap data) could further clarify whether there is oncogene-like overexpression or amplification contributing to the dependency.
