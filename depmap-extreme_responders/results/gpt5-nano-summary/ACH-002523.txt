The most reasonable lead explanation is that SNU‑739 is KDELR2‑addicted because its viability is tightly tied to high‑flux ER secretory traffic and proteostasis that KDELR2 supports. ARF1/COPI‑mediated retrograde transport is needed to recycle ER chaperones, and loss of KDELR2 rapidly depletes folding capacity, triggering lethal ER stress. The cell’s reliance on core fucosylation (FUT8) and α‑dystroglycan priming (B4GAT1) links to RTK signaling and adhesion that depend on proper ER/Golgi trafficking, making KDELR2 essential for maintaining pro‑proliferative cues. TWIST1‑driven EMT and associated Src/FAK signaling create an invasive, secretory program that benefits from KDELR‑mediated chaperone recycling and signaling, so removing KDELR2 collapses both proteostasis and pro‑survival/invasive signals. The HBV‑related ER stress background in SNU‑739 further elevates the reliance on a properly functioning KDELR2 pathway to sustain proteostasis. Altogether, SNU‑739 sits in a glyco‑addicted, secretory‑heavy, redox‑fragile state where KDELR2 is a central bottleneck for survival.

Factors that are not as strong as the lead explanation but may contribute include a Wnt/EMT bias (DVL1 p.G685R and AXIN2 p.I144T) that reinforces EMT and invasive programs, which could heighten dependence on KDELR2‑linked signaling without being the primary cause. ALG3 p.G313E could subtly widen folding/glycosylation margins, increasing reliance on ER chaperone retrieval, though functional validation is needed to confirm its impact in SNU‑739. DNA‑repair mutations (BRCA2 p.R3384Ter, HROB p.E157Ter) and TP53 p.S215R are unlikely to directly create KDELR2 addiction but may elevate baseline proteostatic and oxidative stress, compounding vulnerability. Perturbations of ARF1 or COPI could phenocopy KDELR2 loss to some degree, and chemical chaperones might partially rescue, suggesting supportive but not central roles. In sum, these factors strengthen the model but are not the primary drivers of KDELR2 dependency.

Other interesting facts include that SNU‑739 is HBV‑positive, with HBV transcripts linked to UPR activation, which helps explain the pre‑stressed ER environment that makes KDELR2 non‑negotiable. KDELR2 functions as a GPCR‑like hub that couples to Gαq/11 to activate Src/ERK and FAK, aligning proteostasis with pro‑survival/invasive signaling. The KDELR‑dependent mucin/secretory load management—via autophagy/lysosome repositioning—illustrates how KDELR2 buffers high secretory states, a context mirrored by SNU‑739’s dependencies on PDGFRB/FGF4 and ECM programs. This model envisions multiple reinforcing loops: secretory demand, signaling, and redox stress converge on KDELR2. Testable predictions include rapid XBP1s/CHOP induction, mitochondrial ROS rise, and loss of invadopodia markers upon KDELR2 KO, with partial rescue by KDELR1/3 or PERK/XBP1 modulation. Finally, the combination of male, HBV‑positive HCC lineage and a strongly secretory, mesenchymal state makes SNU‑739 a particularly instructive example of KDELR2 addiction in cancer.
