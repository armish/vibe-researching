The most plausible explanation is that NCIH157DM is addicted to a CRL5-neddylation circuit, with ARIH2 acting as the initiating E3 that primes CRL5 substrate ubiquitination. ARIH2 binds neddylated CUL5–RBX2 and catalyzes the first ubiquitin transfer, a step that cannot proceed if ARIH2 is lost even when the rest of the CRL5 machinery is intact. The dependency pattern includes UBE2F, DCUN1D5, SENP8, RNF7, and CUL5, all of which are required to neddylate and activate CRL5. This tightly coordinated network implies the line relies on a fully tuned CRL5 neddylation/deneddylation cycle to feed ARIH2. Removing ARIH2 would stabilize pro-apoptotic substrates like NOXA, BIM, and BIK, tipping the balance toward apoptosis, and a replication-stress/nuclear-cGAS axis could further contribute to lethality. Taken together, ARIH2 KO likely collapses a CRL5-driven proteostasis and stress-response circuit, explaining the strong lethality.

There are factors that could contribute but are not as central as ARIH2 itself. PRDX1 dependency fits here because PRDX1 bridges UBE2F and CUL5, boosting neddylation and promoting NOXA degradation; this supports the CRL5–NOXA axis but is unlikely to be the sole driver. Additional stress contexts, such as SMARCAL1 dependence, ATR variants, or TP53 truncations, could heighten reliance on CRL5-mediated clearance of pro‑apoptotic substrates, making ARIH2 loss more catastrophic in those backgrounds. SENP8 dependence signals that cells rely on a delicate balance of neddylation and deneddylation, so perturbations elsewhere in the NEDD8 pathway could modulate the phenotype without replacing the primary driver. KEAP1/NRF2–driven oxidative rewiring could further influence the baseline stress environment and, indirectly, how CRL5 substrates accumulate when ARIH2 is lost. Overall, these factors are more modulators of sensitivity than independent, equally strong mechanisms.

Several testable predictions and interesting notes emerge. Co‑KO or knockdown of PMAIP1/NOXA, BCL2L11/BIM, or BIK should partially rescue viability after ARIH2 KO, whereas loss of CUL5, UBE2F, or RNF7 should phenocopy ARIH2 loss. Pharmacologically, MLN4924 (a neddylation inhibitor) should mimic ARIH2 loss, and a pan-caspase inhibitor or enforced MCL1/MCL-xL expression should blunt ARIH2‑KO lethality; if cGAS is involved, CGAS or STING knockdown should provide rescue. Biochemically, ARIH2 KO should lead to increased NOXA/BIM/BIK proteins, decreased CUL5 neddylation, and reduced ubiquitin priming on known CRL5 substrates, with ARIH2 re-expression restoring the baseline. These predictions offer a straightforward path to validate the CRL5–ARIH2 mechanism in NCIH157DM and to clarify the roles of PRDX1 and SENP8 in shaping this dependency. In sum, the data would reinforce the view that this line is “addicted” to a tightly regulated CRL5–neddylation axis for survival.
