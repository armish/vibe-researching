The clearest explanation is that SK-MES-1 relies almost entirely on the glutathione system because its alternative thioredoxin pathway is crippled by a TXNRD1 splice-acceptor mutation, leaving GSR as the essential antioxidant relay. In other words, the thioredoxin reductase arm is nonfunctional, so loss of GSR eliminates the remaining two-electron reductive capacity. GSR KO would drive GSSG accumulation and widespread protein thiol oxidation, tipping the ER and cytosol toward oxidative damage. The ER is already under heavy proteostasis/oxidative‑folding stress in this cell line, as indicated by dependencies on HYOU1, TMEM258, SLC33A1, and SLC35B4, and a PRKCSH nonsense mutation further strains glycoprotein folding. Mutations that compromise GSH handling (ABCC1 nonsense) and mitochondrial redox buffering (SLC25A24 nonsense) further increase sensitivity, since they reduce GSSG export and mitochondrial ROS buffering. Taken together, these features converge on GSR as the single point of failure for maintaining a reduced GSH pool and a viable redox environment.

Several secondary factors could still contribute to the sensitivity, but are not as decisive as the TXNRD1-driven redundancy collapse. The ABCC1 truncation would worsen intracellular GSSG accumulation by reducing export, amplifying oxidative protein modification when GSR is lost. SLC25A24 stop mutation might remove a mitochondrial stress buffer, increasing cytosolic ROS burden in a GSR‑deficient state. PRKCSH truncation and GFPT1 stop-gain both heighten ER stress and glycoprotein folding demand, indirectly magnifying dependence on redox buffering. ADPGK's appearance as a co-dependency fits with ER biogenesis stress, but it is more a modulator of the underlying ER/Glyco load than the core cause. Nevertheless, together these factors could modulate lethality or the threshold for viability in the GSR KO context.

These data point to a broader pattern where ER proteostasis and glycosylation pathways sit at the interface of redox balance and GSR dependence. The strongest GSR‑related dependencies cluster around HYOU1, TMEM258, SLC33A1, and SLC35B4, consistent with high secretory/glycoprotein flux requiring robust redox buffering. ER oxidative folding generates peroxide, so loss of GSH recycling makes cells more vulnerable to ERO1/PRDX4–driven oxidation and mispaired disulfides. The ABCC1/MRP1 function and the SLC25A24 mitochondrial context also matter by shaping GSSG export and mitochondrial ROS tolerance. Your predictions suggest testable readouts like elevated GSSG and S-glutathionylation at baseline, and a sharp shift after GSR KO, which might be alleviated by GSH supplementation or TXNRD1 re-expression. Collectively, these observations reveal not only a lethal vulnerability but also several knobs that could modulate it and be exploited pharmacologically.
