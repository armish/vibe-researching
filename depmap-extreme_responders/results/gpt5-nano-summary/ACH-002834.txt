The most plausible explanation is that SNAI2 acts as a critical survival switch in OS384 by repressing pro-apoptotic BH3-only genes BIM (BCL2L11) and PUMA (BBC3). When SNAI2 is deleted, BIM and PUMA are derepressed and trigger mitochondrial apoptosis, providing a direct route to cell death. This fits with OS384’s top dependencies on replication-stress factors like SMARCAL1, which would amplify apoptotic signaling once SNAI2’s brake is released. ITGB3 dependence suggests that adhesion-survival signaling is also compromised when SNAI2 is gone, potentially triggering anoikis-like death in a stressed context. A cilium–Hedgehog axis is implicated as well: intact ciliary signaling can sustain SNAI2 and Hedgehog activity, so SNAI2 loss may unleash lethal stress in a cilium-dominant tumor. Lastly, the Wnt/p‑EMT wiring (involving TMEM88 and DKK1 mutations) implies that OS384 relies on SNAI2 to balance EMT programs with restrained Wnt signaling, making the loss of SNAI2 particularly deleterious.

Several supportive factors could contribute but are not as strong as the main mechanism. The cilium–Hedgehog axis could amplify SNAI2 dependence, since Hedgehog signaling can upregulate EMT factors like SNAI2 and ciliogenesis can sensitize cells to its loss, though this alone might not cause lethality. Wnt/TGF‑β wiring, shaped by TMEM88 and the DKK1 mutation, could tune the p‑EMT state and vulnerability to SNAI2 loss, but would likely act in concert with SNAI2’s repression of BH3-only genes. ITGB3 dependence points to adhesion-survival signals that could compound death upon SNAI2 knockout, especially in a stressed environment. The replication-stress and DNA-damage angle (SMARCAL1 and potential γH2AX increases) could worsen apoptosis after SNAI2 loss, yet would probably require derepression of BIM/PUMA to produce robust lethality. Finally, ciliogenesis gene mutations (IFT52 missense, RPGR frameshift) align with a cilium-driven background that makes Hedgehog–SNAI2 coupling more critical, but in isolation they would not fully explain the selective lethality without SNAI2 being removed.

Other interesting facts that fit the model include several concrete features of OS384. It is an osteosarcoma line derived from a patient-derived xenograft, a context in which Hedgehog and ciliary signaling are often engaged, aligning with a cilium/Hedgehog–SNAI2 axis. OS384 shows dependencies on ciliary/axonemal genes (CFAP52, DNAI2, RIMBP3, TPGS1) and carries ciliogenesis mutations (IFT52 missense, RPGR frameshift), supporting a ciliopathy-like state that could couple ciliary signaling to SNAI2-driven survival. The SNAI2–EMT relationship appears intertwined with chromatin/repair pathways, given SMARCB1 context and SMARCAL1 dependency, which could heighten apoptotic priming when SNAI2 is lost. TMEM88 and DKK1 interactions point to a Wnt‑tuned, p‑EMT wiring that would be especially fragile if SNAI2 is removed. Together, these observations suggest a multi-layered network fragility in OS384, centered on SNAI2 but modulated by ciliogenesis, Wnt/Hedgehog signaling, and EMT dynamics.
