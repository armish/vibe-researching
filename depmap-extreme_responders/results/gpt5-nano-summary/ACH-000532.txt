SNU61 is best explained as autophagy-addicted. RB1CC1 (FIP200) serves as the core scaffold of the ULK1–ATG13–ATG101 initiation complex that nucleates autophagosomes, so losing FIP200 blocks early autophagy steps. The line’s top dependencies on ATG9A and ATG12 point to a requirement for both phagophore growth and LC3 lipidation, implying survival hinges on intact macroautophagy. High dependence on BIRC6 and UBE2Z signals that ubiquitin–proteostasis flux is tightly coupled to autophagy in this context, reinforcing that autophagy is the primary stress-buffering pathway. Its KRASG12D/TP53/APC/PIK3R1 genotype likely creates substantial metabolic and proteotoxic stress, making RB1CC1 loss especially catastrophic as it shuts down the cell’s main buffering mechanism. A TAX1BP1 coiled‑coil mutation could further increase reliance on RB1CC1-mediated recruitment of the ULK complex, heightening sensitivity to RB1CC1 KO. Taken together, the simplest, most reasonable explanation is that SNU61’s survival depends on autophagy, and RB1CC1 loss collapses that essential pathway.

There are additional factors that might contribute, but they are less definitive than the core autophagy‑initiation requirement. Kras‑driven biology with TP53 loss often makes autophagy essential for mitochondrial function and lipid metabolism, so upstream disruption at RB1CC1 can be particularly lethal in this context, though this is a context-dependent vulnerability. The PIK3R1 truncation could relieve negative PI3K control and sustain anabolic signaling, thereby increasing proteotoxic and energetic stress that autophagy helps to buffer. Variants such as PRDX1 splice alterations, which reduce antioxidant buffering, and ACADM missense/splice variations that could impair medium-chain FAO, may intensify dependence on mitophagy and lipid turnover. However, these factors by themselves are not as strong predictors as the core autophagy initiation dependency. The observed co-dependency on BIRC6/UBE2Z suggests a networked interaction between autophagy and ubiquitin pathways rather than a single, isolated vulnerability.

Other interesting facts worth noting include SNU61’s documented colorectal origin with APC truncation and KRAS G12D, a landscape that commonly stresses WNT/RAS and autophagy‑related pathways. TP53 is mutant (R175H) in this line, and in Kras‑driven settings p53 loss often heightens autophagy dependence to sustain FAO and lipid metabolism. The PIK3R1 truncation may further push the cells toward a high anabolic load that autophagy helps manage. NRF2‑mediated escape has been observed in some autophagy‑deficient cancer cells, offering a potential but rare adaptation route after RB1CC1 loss. The TAX1BP1 p.D308V variant could perturb the RB1CC1–receptor axis, possibly making selective autophagy initiation more rate-limiting. These nuances can guide orthogonal validation experiments and help interpret variability across autophagy-targeting strategies.
