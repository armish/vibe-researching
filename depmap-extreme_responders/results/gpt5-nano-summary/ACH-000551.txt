The most reasonable lead explanation is that MPPE1/PGAP5 loss creates a proteostasis/secretory-pathway synthetic lethality in K562. MPPE1/PGAP5 trims the ethanolamine-phosphate side chain on Man2 of GPI anchors, enabling p24 cargo‑receptor–mediated ER exit of GPI‑APs. When MPPE1 is lost, GPI‑APs are retained in the ER, triggering ER quality control and tipping the unfolded protein response toward apoptosis. If the UPR cannot restore homeostasis, CHOP/DR5 signaling drives cell death. K562 already lives on a knife‑edge of ER stress due to BCR‑ABL–driven signaling, TP53 defect, and extra hits in ER chaperoning/glycosylation genes, so removing MPPE1 pushes it over the edge. Thus MPPE1 KO represents a context-specific vulnerability rooted in a proteostasis bottleneck.

Other contributing factors, though weaker than the main explanation, could still shape sensitivity. Additional “second-hit” variants in ER folding/glycosylation pathways (for example HSPA5/BiP truncation, GANAB, P4HB, and DOLK variants) would further constrain ER proteostasis and glycosylation throughput, intensifying the burden when MPPE1 is lost. These factors plausibly produce a multi-gene synthetic sickness/lethality with PGAP5 loss, even if each on its own is not sufficient. Loss of GPI‑AP–dependent signaling tone—since GPI‑APs organize lipid rafts and modulate Src-family kinase signaling—could blunt pro-survival BCR‑ABL–related outputs, lightly amplifying sensitivity. Together, these weaker elements help explain variability in response and still align with the idea that a generalized proteostasis limit underlies MPPE1’s lethality in this background. The core vulnerability remains the ABL/BCR‑driven, TP53‑defective context, which MPPE1 loss then exploits.

Other interesting facts and testable implications. A good validation path is to measure GPI‑AP surface display after MPPE1 KO (e.g., FLAER, CD55/CD59) to confirm trafficking failure. Monitoring ER stress and UPR readouts (ATF4, CHOP, spliced XBP1, DR5, caspase‑8) would corroborate the apoptosis link via ER overload. Partial chemical rescue with chaperones like 4‑PBA or TUDCA would support a proteostasis‑overload mechanism. Re-expression of WT PGAP5/MPPE1 should restore GPI‑AP export and viability, whereas a catalytically dead mutant should not rescue. Additional tests could include partial mitigation by BCR‑ABL inhibition or enhanced toxicity with tunicamycin to explore the interaction between ER burden and BCR‑ABL signaling.
