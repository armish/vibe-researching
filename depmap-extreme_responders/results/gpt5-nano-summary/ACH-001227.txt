The most reasonable leading explanation is that UPCISCC090 has HPV16-driven focal amplifications that include FOXE1, creating a lineage-transcription factor addiction in a keratinocyte/HNSCC context. The HPV integration events flank these amplifications, and the FOXE1 copy number is about sevenfold, which can make FOXE1 essential for survival when perturbed. FOXE1 is a direct GLI2 target in basal keratinocytes and can drive EMT programs through ZEB1, and this particular line also carries a GLI2 missense variant that could tune that axis. Together, the HPV-driven FOXE1 amplification and the Hedgehog/GLI context likely render the cell highly FOXE1-dependent. The broader HPV+ HNSCC wiring—E6–UBE3A, PSMD10/gankyrin, PIM1 amplification, and SOX2 lineage reliance—helps sustain a transcriptional and proteostasis state that becomes brittle when a key amplified TF is removed. In short, a combination of local FOXE1 amplification and keratinocyte lineage signaling best explains the extreme sensitivity to FOXE1 knockout.

There are factors not as strong as the initial explanation but that might still contribute to sensitivity. The HPV E6–UBE3A axis and PSMD10/gankyrin dependencies reflect a viral-oncogene–driven proteostasis/transcriptional state that can heighten reliance on key TF networks. PIM1 amplification provides an additional, co-existing driver that fits the theme of HPV integration creating local dependencies. SOX2 amplification reinforces squamous lineage wiring, making the network more vulnerable to perturbations in core lineage TFs like FOXE1. Copy-number effects in CRISPR screens can inflate apparent essentiality in highly amplified regions, so some of the FOXE1 signal may reflect CN artifacts rather than pure gene-specific lethality. Therefore, validating with CRISPR interference or RNAi and rescue experiments is important to distinguish true dependency from CN-cutting toxicity.

Other interesting facts include the following: FOXE1 is a direct GLI2 target in keratinocytes, situating it within a Hedgehog transcriptional circuit relevant to squamous epithelium. The GLI2 S562I variant could further modulate this axis, potentially reinforcing FOXE1 expression in UPCISCC090. FOXE1 directly upregulates ZEB1 and can promote EMT programs, linking TF addiction to plasticity and survival in epithelial cancers. The HPV E6–UBE3A and PSMD10 dependencies illustrate how viral wiring interacts with host proteostasis to shape vulnerability. The co-amplifications of PIM1 and SOX2 exemplify a broader pattern where HPV-driven focal amplifications create local dependencies on lineage-related transcriptional nodes. Taken together, these observations suggest that orthogonal perturbations (CRISPRi, siRNA) and pathway readouts will be valuable to confirm and further dissect the mechanism and its potential therapeutic implications.
