The most reasonable explanation is that RPMI-2650 is driven by a BRD4–NUTM1 fusion, and NUTM1 knockout removes the fusion oncoprotein, collapsing the megadomain-driven chromatin state and transcription program that the fusion creates. Without this program, cells rapidly differentiate toward a squamous lineage and stop growing, which explains the observed growth arrest. This represents a fusion-specific oncogene addiction rather than a general requirement for NUTM1 in somatic cells. The BRD4–NUTM1 ex15:ex2 configuration in RPMI‑2650 is documented, reinforcing its classification as a NUT carcinoma–type dependency. BET inhibitors or p300/CBP inhibitors phenocopy this effect, supporting the link between the fusion-driven transcriptional state and sensitivity to disruption. CERES-corrected CRISPR data further argue that this is a true dependency rather than a copy-number artifact.

Beyond the primary driver, several co-dependencies fit with the transcriptional and metabolic pressure created by BRD4–NUTM1. For example, TAF11, a core Pol II initiation factor, and FBXO28, which enhances MYC-driven transcription, align with the MYC/TP63/SOX2–driven program characteristic of NUT carcinoma. RNA-modification enzymes such as TRUB1 and TRMT2B could support elevated transcription and translation needs by maintaining RNA and mitochondrial translation efficiency. Mitochondrial factors like NDUFAF5 and NDUFB8 hint at a potential oxidative phosphorylation vulnerability in fast-proliferating, hypertranscribing cells. Other hits (PSENEN, GJC1, CDH11, IRS4) may reflect context-specific survival or signaling requirements that modulate growth or differentiation but are not canonical NUT carcinoma drivers. There is also a plausible, though not experimentally proven, possibility that SUZ12 p.R563H subtly shifts chromatin, increasing acetylation and sensitivity to BRD4–NUTM1 perturbation.

To validate and extend these ideas, you should confirm the fusion junction in your cells (RNA-seq fusion caller; BRD4–NUTM1 FISH; NUT immunohistochemistry) and ensure your CRISPR guides target the actual fusion exons. Pharmacologic disruption with BET inhibitors (e.g., birabresib, molibresib) or a p300/CBP inhibitor like A-485 is expected to recapitulate fusion-knockout phenotypes if the model is truly fusion-driven. If feasible, testing whether MYC overexpression can rescue growth after NUTM1 loss would be a classic functional readout in NUT carcinoma. Some of the listed co-dependencies may reflect the transcription/translation demands of the fusion-driven state rather than independent targets. Note that BRD4–NUTM1–driven cancers often show variant sensitivities to BET inhibitors depending on the fusion junctions, and CERES-corrected DepMap data support that the NUTM1 dependency is not a CN artifact. Finally, RPMI-2650 is reported as BRD4–NUTM1 ex15:ex2 fusion–positive, reinforcing the fusion-addiction interpretation.
